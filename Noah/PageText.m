    [pageText addObject:@"Noah, and his wonderful day with Bob. By Richard Gomez. Illustrated by Adam Taylor."];
    [pageText addObject:@"One fine Saturday afternoon, in the middle of March, a little boy named Noah was playing in the park with his Dad. As they were getting ready to go home, Noah looked on the ground and saw a spider. Look, Dad, Noah cried. A spider."];
    [pageText addObject:@"Noah picked up the spider, but it was not moving. Why isn't it moving, Dad?, asked Noah. That's because it's dead, Son. Dad explained, sadly."];
	[pageText addObject:@"Can I keep him? Asked Noah? Keep Him? Dad asked back. Why do you want a dead spider? I like his colors, and he looks alive, enough. Please Dad! Noah begged. Ok, Dad said reluctantly. But, what will we keep him in until we get home?"];
	[pageText addObject:@""];
	[pageText addObject:@"Noah thought for a second, and then he remembered the sandwich baggie he had in his pocket. Mom always packed he and his dad a peanut butter sandwich when they went to the park, and he always saved his baggie."];
	[pageText addObject:@"Taking the baggie from his pocket, I can put him in this! , Noah said excitedly. That will work fine!, Dad agreed. Noah put the dead spider in his baggie, and he and Dad went home."];
	[pageText addObject:@"When he got home, Noah ran into the house holding his baggie out in front of him, screaming, Mom! Look what I found! Look what I found!"];
	[pageText addObject:@"Mom was in the kitchen when she heard Noah cry her name. He sure does sound excited about whatever it is he has found, she thought. Maybe he found me a flower, and he cannot wait to get it into some water before it withers. Now mom was getting excited."];
	[pageText addObject:@""];
	[pageText addObject:@"Noah came storming into the kitchen holding the baggie out in front of him. Still screaming, look what I found! Mom saw the spider in the baggie and jumped two feet into the air. And yelled eek! a spider! Don't worry, Mom. He's dead, explained Noah. Dead or alive, I do not want that spider in my house!, mom exclaimed."];
	[pageText addObject:@"Please, Mom! Begged Noah. I promise never to take him out of the baggie. Mom reluctantly agreed, Ok, but you keep him in the baggie, and keep that baggie out of my kitchen. Thank you, Mom! cried Noah, as he jumped into the air and hugged her. You're welcome, now go play with your new, um, pet. I am making dinner. Mom said."];
	[pageText addObject:@"As Noah left the kitchen he noticed one of the legs had fallen off of his spider. It's broken! Noah said to his dad. It's decomposing, Son. Dad explained. It's something that happens to all living creatures when they die. Well, I better be extra careful with him then, said Noah."];
	[pageText addObject:@"Him? Asked Dad. Was he a boy spider? Yup, said Noah, and I'm going to name him Bob! And he and Bob went upstairs to play."];
	[pageText addObject:@"What kind of game do you want to play, Bob? Asked Noah. Of course, Bob did not answer, but Noah acted like he did. Cops and Robbers? Sounds good, Noah said, being agreeable."];
	[pageText addObject:@"They not only played cops and robbers, but they also played cowboys and indians."];
	[pageText addObject:@"And they played tag, and they played checkers."];
	[pageText addObject:@""];
	[pageText addObject:@"And they raced cars."];
	[pageText addObject:@"They played so many games that Noah lost count. Noah was having so much fun that he didn't realize, the more he played with Bob, the more Bob fell apart. Dinner time! Mom said. Noah picked up Bob's baggie and shoved it into his pocket, and ran downstairs for dinner."];
	[pageText addObject:@""];
	[pageText addObject:@"After dinner, Noah was excited to get back to playing with Bob. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the baggie. Bob was in a bunch of tiny pieces. Noah was very sad."];
	[pageText addObject:@"I think it's time for you to bury your spider, Noah. Mom said. Why? asked Noah. Because that's what we do when things we love pass on, explained Dad. Where do we bury him? Asked Noah. Anywhere you want, said Dad. Right outside my window? Noah asked. That's a great place, said Mom."];
	[pageText addObject:@"So that is what they did, they buried Bob right outside of Noah's bedroom window."];
	[pageText addObject:@"That night, as Noah lay in his bed, he thought about his friend Bob. And he thought about his friend Bob and his wonderful day with him until his eyes closed and he fell asleep."];
	[pageText addObject:@"The End."];
